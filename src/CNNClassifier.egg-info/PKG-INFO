## How to run

+ STEP 01- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dahshury/Kidney-Disease-Classification-DL-Project
```

+ STEP 02- Create a conda environment after opening the repository

```bash
conda create -n kidney python=3.8 -y
```

```bash
conda activate kidney
```

+ STEP 03- install the requirements

Installing dependancies from requirements.txt

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependancies for training using GPU (optional):

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0
```



### To Run prediction using the pretrained model

run the following command in the terminal

```bash
python app.py
```

Now, open the following link in the browser

```bash
 127.0.0.1:8080
```
